title:  Santa's Fantastic Factory
---

When Nessie & Her Beard released "Santa’s Fantastic Factory," the 2008 holiday season was illuminated by one of the most creative Christmas singles in years. Armed with extensive knowledge of Christmas music from the past century and beyond, Nessie and her elusive supporting cast created a certifiable smorgasbord of holiday sounds. The eclectic arrangement includes synthesizers, a 1930's-style mouth trumpet, and more from the bevy of forgotten instruments sprinkled liberally throughout every Nessie release. Sparkling with creative energy, this tune finds Nessie at her most chillingly melodic, incorporating intricate harmony into her expansive vocal repertoire "Santa’s Fantastic Factory" is the first of what we hope will be many holiday singles to come from OCR.
